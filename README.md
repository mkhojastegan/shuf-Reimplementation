```shuf``` is a Linux command to generate random numbers. This implementation creates
shuf for any platform using Python. Some options, including ```--input-range``` and
```--head-count``` are also included in this script.

# Usage
This script can be run on Microsoft Windows and UNIX-like operating systems. Simply
use the script within a terminal as you normally would use shuf in a Linux shell.
